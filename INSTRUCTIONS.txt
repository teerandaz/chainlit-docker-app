HERE ARE A THINGS TO NOTE AND GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS : 

My Gemini API key is present in the '.env' file and you can use that. I have built the app with 'gemini-1.5-flash' model.

Use the following code to build and run the application using DOCKER containers in your local folder - 
BUILD CONTAINER : docker build --no-cache -t chainlit-app .
RUN CONTAINER : docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env chainlit-app
