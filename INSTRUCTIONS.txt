HERE ARE A THINGS TO NOTE AND GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS :

I have used Gemini Api instead of OpenAI Api while making sure everything in the problem statement is followed.
I was facing errors while giving credit card informationa and buying credits for OpenAI api and hence used Gemini API. 

My Gemini API key is present in the '.env' file and you can use that. I have built the app with 'gemini-1.5-flash' model.

Use the following code to build and run the application using DOCKER containers in your local folder - 
BUILD CONTAINER : docker build --no-cache -t chainlit-app .
RUN CONTAINER : docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env chainlit-app
